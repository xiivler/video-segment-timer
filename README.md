# video-segment-timer
The timer is currently published at https://vidtimer.com.

Determines the time of a segment within a video in frames and in milliseconds.

Supports YouTube videos, Twitch VODs, Twitter videos, URLs that lead directly to a video file (ex. Discord attachments), and uploaded files.

Uses dylanpdx's [BetterTwitFix](https://github.com/dylanpdx/BetterTwitFix), a fork of robinuniverse's [TwitFix](https://github.com/robinuniverse/TwitFix) to get the URL for Twitter video sources.

Credit to [LosManos](https://github.com/LosManos), Lasnv, and [jeffreypriebe](https://github.com/jeffreypriebe) for code for parsing YouTube URLs.
